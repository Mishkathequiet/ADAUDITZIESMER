# At least as of 2021-12-04, this tends to hang Visual Studio Code if run normally from within VSC.
# This seems to be due to VSC attaching a debugger and then struggling to track breakpoints used by Pester, with no option that I can find at present to disable.
# For now, recommend simply running directly from a PowerShell console:
#   .\Coverage.ps1
# Please provide feedback if anyone knows or finds a better way to manage this...

#Requires -Version 5.1
#Requires -Modules @{ModuleName='Pester'; ModuleVersion='5.3.1'}
